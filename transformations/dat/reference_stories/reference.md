Present-day 2038, “Net Neutrality” has been unalived for almost two decades. A small rebel group travels back to 2017 to try and change it all…

Just as Donald was about to press the button that would trigger the bomb - the one that would level the FCC headquarters - he heard a voice.

Named after Donald Trump, the First Inaugurator of the Great American Monopoly, Donald had never heard English spoken with an accent like the one the voice carried:

"I'm gunna need ya to put that trigga down mate."

There was a distinct menace in the tone and the confidence of someone who is usually obeyed.

Donald hesitated, wondering if this was one of those illegal aliens people talked about from the time before the walls. People always said that aliens talked funny, but few in 2038 had heard one.

"I dinnea think he underrrstood ye" a second voice muttered before a third voice exclaimed, "Be a good chap and place the trigger on the bed. We won't unalive you unless you refuse."

Donald whirled around, expecting to see little grey men or green sludge monsters. The sight that greeted him was significantly more perplexing. Three men, well dressed, well-armed (at least Donald assumed the things they were pointing at him were weapons), and one of them carried something that he had never seen before - a smallish rectangular object which had moving pictures on the top face - the person holding it was jabbing at it and running his fingers across the images.

The first voice spoke again - coming from the closest man, who waved his 'gun' to get Donald's attention. "For the last time, put down tha bloomin' trigga!"

So, your typical college girl lookalike but for the number above her head.

Three thousand and nine.

What. The. Hell.

"There might be an issue with your age," I blurted before I could stop myself.

"Excuse me?" she said in a faintly European accent. Other than her mouth, the rest of her hadn't moved at all—even the fingers clutching the purse in front of her were like cold marble. I could feel goosebumps popping up on my arms as I reached for her ID.

"Sorry, just give me a moment to check," I said, darting furtive looks at the age number above her head as though I expected it to change at any time. I'd never been wrong before; perhaps this was the first time?

Her name was Helena Ricci. Born here in the US twenty-two years ago. I ran the scanner over it. Clean. Crap.

"Er, I'll need just a moment to register you into our system," I said.

"Take your time. I've got plenty," she said. Her eyes remained cold above her smile.

Once the process was complete, I handed the card back to her. "Have a pleasant evening."

She took the card and stalked off into the club. I felt tempted to go after her—so many questions were in my head—but that would mean revealing my gift. And one didn't go around spouting such nonsense so easily, so my dad had warned me.

I threw my attention back to the impatient and growing line of patrons waiting for me.

The hours flew by. I kept an eye out for Helena among the clubbers trickling out. Once, I thought I saw her in the midst of a small group of men, who went and lounged by a Levante parked not far away. They smoked for a while before returning to the club.

At about four in the morning, when activity was visibly slowing down, she left the club, flashing me a grin on the way. That, more than anything, helped make up my mind.

"Helena," I called, jogging from my post to catch up to her. "I've got something I want to ask you."

She paused in her step but maintained her distance out of my arm's reach. "Yes?"

I tore my eyes away from her numbers and met her searching gaze. "How old are you?"

She snorted. "Really? We're still not over this?"

Harry strode forward as the two collapsed before him. The pair of Death Eaters had been trying to take him by surprise. But years of living under the Dursley's torment, coupled with his time as a Seeker, had left his senses honed for even the smallest of disturbances. They would have been better off running. At least then, Harry would have been able to enjoy hunting them down.

"VOLDEMORT!!!" Harry roared, his voice echoing in the darkness of the woods. "It's time for us to end this little game." He looked around, knowing that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wouldn’t be far behind his followers.

He had hunted Voldemort into the Muggle world, and across Britain, waiting for this day. Since birth, Voldemort had hunted him, the very wizard prophesied to bring the Dark Lord to his knees. Years had gone by, and his thirst for the unaliving of the Boy Who Lived had become an obsession no amount of power could quench.

What he hadn't known was that, at the same time, Harry had been hunting him back. Tracking down the Horcruxes had been no easy task, but he had done it. Gringotts, Hogwarts, the oceanside cave... that one had been fun, really. Abandoning Dudley to be torn to pieces more than made up for the disappointment of the Horcrux not being where it should have been. And getting to take the real Horcrux from Umbridge. Harry's face twisted with a smile as he remembered the previous headmistress. He remembered how, when she had tortured him with the Black Quill, the words he’d written down would be excruciatingly carved over his skin. He would later take his revenge, by etching the words, “I must not tell lies” on Umbridge’s throat.

Harry’s last encounter with Voldemort had surprised everyone. When he had strode into the Ministry of Magic, demanding Voldemort stand before him, the world expected that to be a kind of death wish upon himself. The end of James and Lily Potter’s only son. Voldemort had summoned all of his Death Eaters, hoping to put on a show and prove once and for all that he truly was the greatest wizard to have lived.

Right at that moment, Nagini slid across the floor. As it was making its way to Harry, the boy wizard unalived it.
