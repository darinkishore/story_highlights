    You've finally done it. You've proven the existence of magic; discovered how an ordinary human cast spells to control that immense arcane power. There's just one problem making you hesitate about publishing your findings: spellcasting looks very... STUPID…


"The first spell I ever cast was a complete accident. One moment, I was recording my chemistry experiment for a class demonstration project, and the next, I found myself on the ground looking up at a tear in the fabric of space-time." The lecture hall was fixated on me, eagerly awaiting the punchline.


I advanced to the next slide, revealing one of the most embarrassing leaps in human development history. Laughter erupted until I resumed speaking with utmost sincerity.


"Without this video, I wouldn't have believed it myself." I held up my hands. "And those watching might argue that it's just CGI. Those who know me can confirm that my computer skills are as terrible as my coordination, as you've just witnessed."


"I understand that without real-life evidence, many of you might not believe me. So today, I intend to perform the spell here to prove it." From beneath the table, I retrieved my box of supplies and began setting up. 


I donned my lab coat, set up the portable Bunsen burner and flask holder, and arranged distilled water and magnesium chlorate. The setup took some time, which worked to my advantage. "Over the past month, my friends and I have tirelessly attempted to recreate and refine this process."


"We documented every attempt and left no stone unturned in our research. The ritual doesn't rely on any astronomical or atmospheric conditions. It isn't tied to any discernible caster's innate attributes. The choice of ingredients isn't crucial, and the heat source is irrelevant."


I let out a sigh.


"Unfortunately, the source of heat matters. As soon as the solution reaches 93 degrees Celsius, I'll commence the ritual. And before that happens, I want to emphasize: Every. Single. Step. Counts."


While some continued to chuckle, either at me or thinking it was some prank, I focused on the rising thermometer.


91... 92... 93. That was the lowest temperature we found to make it work.


Showtime.


My left hand swiftly knocked the flask as I pretended to lose balance and spin around. The flask went airborne as I suppressed a hiss and began the incantation. "Fugono!" Turning back as if lunging for the glass, I observed it shattering against the table while pretending to fall. Deliberately.


I flung my legs sideways, maintaining the incantation. "Shi-" I let out an indescribable gasp as I hit the ground with my side, my arms still outstretched toward the glass. "-gahsinfabish!"


I clenched my fists, wrapping my arm around my genuinely bruised knee, and uttered the final words, hoping I hadn't messed up anything. "Gidameedit!"


Laughter halted as an inky black portal materialized in the air above the spilled and broken flask. I flung my hands backward and skittered away, feigning surprise, which caused a second portal to appear beneath me. I tumbled through and landed on the wreckage of my experiment, but my padded lab coat shielded me.


Rolling off the debris, I took a few seconds to collect myself before standing and facing my class.


Professor Ward shattered the awed silence by standing and scrutinizing the portals. "Mr. Harris, this is... incredibly impressive." He tossed a pencil through and observed it emerging on the other side. "And how long does it last?"


"Eleven minutes and five seconds, approximately."


"Fascinating. And... was all that flailing necessary?"


"You might recall there was a lot more in the original video. This was the most I could remove so far. I'm working on reducing it further."


"Fantastic. Truly and simply fantastic." His elderly face beamed with a bright smile, and a knot of tension unraveled inside me. Temporarily. "It's a shame you didn't submit the protocol on time. Therefore, I'm afraid I can't give it a grade higher than a B."

    r"""Your pointless superpower is that you know how many people’s lives you save with your actions. One day, at a Subway, you tell the cashier you want your sandwich on Italian bread, and you’re suddenly informed that you just saved five billion people.



Most days, a number flashes through my mind.

It's usually when I'm out somewhere, after I've made a conscious choice. Push the button and wait rather than jaywalk? Plus two.

Phone an ambulance when I saw that drunk guy asleep on the floor? Plus one.

That time I signed a friend's passport? Plus sixteen.

They weren't always positive, of course. Once every other week, I might get a negative. That time I chose the cheaper phone contract? Negative four. That time I upvoted a thread about rice recipes on Reddit? Negative one. Last Thursday when I ignored the withheld number calling me? Negative four.

I've never quite understood how it works, but since these delusions began, I began to name it Karma. Good actions tend to lend themselves to positive numbers; lousy ones seem more likely to produce negatives.

​

I attended a neurology appointment to check this out, but I got no answers. I remember the Plus five from making the initial selfreferral, present and clean in the memory like it were a butterfly drifting past my field of vision.

The neurologist was a consultant called Miss Wight. She checked my vision, listened to my tales, asked me to keep a diary of instances the numbers flick through my mind. She talked about synaesthesia, suggested a scan, further study. She was excited a little too excited, when I agreed to take the diary, and I gasped as a tiny plus one rose like steam from the diary.

"I saw it again," I explained. "Just now. When I took the diary."

"I see," said Miss Wight, trying to retain professional composure. "What number was it?"

"One," I said. "Positive one. Most of the time it's small numbers."

"Is it ever fractions? Zeroes?"

I thought about this for a moment. "No... I think it's always been a whole number. As for zero.... I guess most things I do during the day don't have meaning. "

"You feel meaning is important, don't you?"

​

I do, of course. Perhaps it's the narrative I make for myself. She and I discussed how to write in it, and agreed to meet again in six weeks time. Exhausting work, and time for lunch.

There is a Subway knockoff sandwich store just opposite the train station. I'm not sure what it is about their food prep, but it knocks my socks off every time.

There were quite a few customers at tables, but no queue. The serving girl was one I knew by face, with a hot pink lip piercing. Her colleague, the manager, was milling about grumpily. She ignored him and smiled with familiarity. "Morning! What can I get you? Usual?"

The usual. "You know me too well. Large please."

"What bread would you like?"

Unlike the veggie filling, I like to vary the bread and the sauces, depending on my mood. I looked at the types, deliberating. They all look good. I take a moment to look at the loaves at the back and decide that of the ones she is most likely to grab, the Italian looks the nicest.

"Uh, the Italian, please. Large."

She gets to work picking it up and sawing into the loaf with a knife. As she does though, my brain sears as a number obscures my vision:

+4,982,041,920

For a moment I am disoriented. I can't even identify the number. It's four milli no, billion. Nearly five billion. I try to capture the number in my memory. I blink and it's gone, but an after image feels like it's burned into my retina. I drink it in, try to tap the number discreetly on my thigh as though it's a phone or calculator, hoping the muscle memory in my fingers will help retain it and

"Shanae, I'm going on my break now, all right?"

It was the manager, looming over her shoulder as she shoved diced olives into the Italian. She was a pleasant enough gal Sasha, if memory served but clearly disillusioned with her job. She already had a pack of cigarettes in his hand.

"Sure," Shanae said, putting my order in the oven. "Oh! Just a thought: before you go, could you get some more Italian out of stores, please? We're running a bit low."

Sasha's eyes flickered to the oven and the counter, before stalking back the way she came. Shanae took her gloves off and asked me about sauces. Spicy onion. No numbers.

It wasn't until I sat at a vacant table by the storefront that I got the book out and wrote the number down as best I could. Almost five billion. This had better be a good sandwich.

I looked up as Sasha finally walked past briskly for her break, hair pulled into a bun. I watched her step outside into the path of a suited man, who apologised profusely, then stared agog.

"Sasha Ickneld?"

She looked at the man, trying to place him. After a few seconds she beamed: "Daniel Matthews? I wouldn't have recognised you with that beard! How are you doing? I haven't seen you since school!"

I took a moment to eavesdrop on their conversation, how he was heading to the train station to go to some kind of expo show. Sasha sounded a bit embarrassed about working in the service industry, but this Daniel, he didn't seem to mind. In fact, he suggested they sit down and talk for a bit, as his current business project involved food waste.

I listened to two old school friends plan to put the world to rights, but by the time the global food crises were averted a decade later, I had no memory of the day, save for a large number in a tiny diary.

    You're an actor famous for playing a god on stage. That god is now at your front door asking if you could cover for them while they go on holiday.


"That play a week ago, let me tell you, man, I positively loved it," the man sitting on the couch said. He was, by any and all measures, beautiful. He had flowing black hair, piercing violet eyes, a jaw you could break a wall with. 


Combined with his perfect musculature, fully on display thanks to him only wearing a toga, he was enough to make anyone question their sexuality. I had a feeling that he knew my eyes were darting all over him and didn't mind one bit.


"R- right," I spurted out nervously. "Can I, uh, offer you anything? Wine, perhaps?"


"Aw, that's kind of you, really, but please, allow me," he said with a wide smile and reached behind his back, somehow producing a flagon. He poured both of us hearty portions of wine. Still unsure if I was dreaming or not, I carefully took a sip.


It was the best wine I've ever tasted. I rushed to take another, far larger sip.


"Oh, and the tragedy a fortnight ago? The, uh, uh..." he snapped his fingers trying to remember.


"The Bacchae?" I reminded him carefully.


"That's the one!" he jovially called out. "Let me tell you, beautiful stuff, man. You really did me justice there, really did."


"I'm honored, my lord," I smiled nervously.


"Ah, but - I can see it on your face man. You're wondering why I'm here, paying you a visit?"


I nodded.


"Don't worry man, it's nothing terrible. I've been to all your plays, I love your stuff, I do. Every time you portray me, it's just-" he pumped his fist excitedly. "And, well... I got a favor to ask, you see?"


My heart sank a little. A god asking a mortal a favor? This... this could not go well for me.


"Nah, it will go well for you, don't worry," he said with a smile and got up, pacing up and down the room. I didn't know what was more terrifying - that he could read my mind, or the favor he was about to ask.


"See, I need a little... time off," he said and finished his drink. He leaned on the window frame and took a long, calm look at the evening countryside. "It's my brother. Hermes. With the war, he's been... so busy escorting all those souls, never catching a break, I can see how tired he is, ya know? Not that he'd let anyone know, of course," he said with a hearty laugh and looked at me as if I could possibly understand.


"So, I've been thinking," he said and clasped his hands together, "me, him, maybe Artemis and Apollo - we go on a little vacation. Athena already agreed to give the fighting a little rest, a bit of a ceasefire, to allow the lot of us a breather."


"Lady Athena managed a ceasefire?" I raised an eyebrow. "Wouldn't-"


"Ares throw a fit? You know it, man, you should have seen him, absolutely seething," he laughed. "But, even he agreed. Say what you will about him, but he does care for his family. Without our little brother, the battlefield would be overflowing with shades - no fun in that! Anyway - that's where you come in!"


My eyes went wide. Oh no, what could this...


"I need you to stand in for me!" he said happily.


"I... beg your pardon?" I said after a brief pause.


"You stand in for me! You know, like, take my place for a week. Handle the little things, minor blessings, maybe a curse or two, you know! You've nailed my style in the plays, you'll do grand as the actual thing!"


His unbridled enthusiasm and certainty concerned me, yet... to see a god be so sure you'll be of help to them was immensely confidence-boosting.


"But... my lord, I don't- I can't do what you do, it's-" I protested.


"Aw, come on man, of course I thought of that," he smiled and touched my forehead. His hand was warm and smelled faintly of grapes. I felt a surge of warmth flow through me. Everything seemed... so much brighter now. I looked down at my hands and saw my veins pulsating with... it almost looked like my blood had turned to gold.


"That should cover you," he said. "You'll hear prayers - only the big ones, of course, and you'll find yourself fully able to make appearances to a few select seers when they invoke you. Really, though, just enjoy it, man! I guarantee you'll love it, absolutely guarantee it! Just, uh, be wary of Aphrodite, you get what I mean?" he said and playfully nudged his elbow into my ribs.


"I will... I will do my best. Thank you, Lord Dionysus," I said. I started to bow but he grabbed my shoulders and stopped me.


"No," he said with a laugh and bowed theatrically, "Thank you, Lord Dionysus."

     You are a vampire. If one of your victims isn't completely drained of blood, they reanimate as a newborn vampire, which by law, you are now responsible for. You have always carefully avoided this, until one morning you notice a sticky note on the door of your apartment, "I lived, bitch."




Huh.

That's a rude way to address someone. Especially a stranger.

I trace one finger over the sticky note, a fleck of something brown on the top right corner. The script flows and curls, like if a ballroom dress could be shrunk down and scrawled out on paper.

My head aches, but that's my fault. I try to stay away from getting blooddrunk, but sometimes you need to celebrate. Five hundred years is a relatively healthy age for a vampire, and I'm proud of myself. I went two hundred years without a single sip of blood, and decided to go out for drinks with the boys. Well, that's not counting the other few drains I took these past few weeks. So I was mostly sober for two hundred years. That's better than most.

Either way, you know how it goes; one thing leads to another, and the next thing you know you've got some smelly drunk at your feet, skin stretched tight across the face, mouth contorted in a silent scream. Dry, dry, dry.

I mean I'm a pretty careful dude. Always wear a condom, look both ways to cross the street, and whenever you make a kill, be sure to drain that son of a bitch dry.

There's the law, though not in the way the humans understand it. Blood law, bound by ancient customs and dark spells. The kind of magic the humans once had when they danced around their campfires, nude and hooting out protective wards to keep us back. Salt and omens, crosses and shamanistic idols.

Not that it worked, mind you. But you have to appreciate their gusto. Religious symbols, silver blades and shot. Holy water and stakes, garlic and running water. The tricks and ideas of a scared species.

I lived, bitch.

Well there's a lot of implications in that. Did I murder someone last night? Or a week before?

I don't think so. It was two dollar rails at Shelly's, and someone must have cut themselves by accident or something since all the boys got all rustled up.

There's the flat taste of iron in my mouth, unmistakable if mostly forgotten. When I'd first been turned I used to be able to drain six men in a single night, rarely returning to a fully human form by the end of the night. Sleeping until early afternoon, waking up and walking out into the supposedly lethal sun to find a whole group of peasants trying to stake you.

Looks like I partook. Though I don't remember who or what I drained. That's what you get when you mix blood and alcohol. Both of them serve to enhance the other, and hooboy did that shit work its magic.

Should have gone drinking with Ricky. No matter how blood drunk that man gets, he's always methodical with disposal. Trusses the bodies up like deer, collecting every drop of blood in a bucket before doing that final drain. Like trying to drink a thick milkshake through a straw to get the very last drop.

Can't have too many of us wandering around. Tends to get the humans worked up and throwing garlic and other foolish peasant remedies around. Not that any of that shit works.

I got back early in the morning, though the apartment looks like a tornado decided to make a casual stroll through my living room. Overturned furniture, marks on the walls, shattered glass and what appears to be some urine stains on the back wall.

There's snoring coming from the bedroom.

It appears our intruder is still inside.

Walking past the kitchen, I step over some broken wood and the remains of my nicer glassware.

Son of a bitch. Those were my favorite tumblers.

On my bed, shredded and torn, lies the still form of a man in what looks like his early thirties. Slight potbelly, stout arms, a strong nose and dusty brown hair. One boot on, one boot off. Pants stained with various liquids that must be a mix of wine and something else.

Jesus, the smell.

With one hand, I extend claws. Might as well test it. Black and cold, sharper than a razor and harder than steel.

I sweep downwards, long hooks gleaming in the morning light, hoping it'll shred right through his flesh.

My claws glance off, like I've just tried to slice through a concrete wall with a butter knife.

Shit.

Shit, shit, SHIT

With a deep sigh, I pull the man off the bed, his head slamming down onto the floor below. He'll be in a weakened state most likely, and without proper nurturing he'll die. And that's a problem for everyone involved here. Most importantly, a problem for me. And those are the only ones that matter.

He jerks awake, pulling himself into a sitting position.

"The freak?"

"The freak is right. What the hell are you doing in my apartment?"

He blinks up at me, confusion eventually replaced by recognition.

Then anger. The dull anger of a man with everything taken from him. It'll pass, eventually. Time and patience tend to overcome your emotions faster than you'd expect.

He tries to lunge at me, but one swipe sends him into the wall, barreling over and crashing over discarded clothing.

"You son of a bitch," he spits, "You turned me into a monster!" He must be hungry and confused about what's happening to him. It's really unpleasant in the beginning, with all the muscles and organs rearranging themselves, but still. Have some courtesy.

"Look, I don't really remember you."

His jaw drops, shock and insult marked on his face. If he was still human, he'd probably try to fight me or do some real damage, but he must have worn himself out last night. I'm assuming he followed my scent, but most likely doesn't understand why or how he knew to do that. It's the kind of a survival instinct, the way kittens with eyes that won't even open know to automatically suckle at their mother's breast.

"Call it a bad night out," I say, pulling out a cell phone from my pocket. How much time do I have? It's bad enough I couldn't smell him earlier, what's even worse is I have no idea he's been walking around without our ritual performed upon him. This is why you don't drink and drain, kids.

Another blood bound soul, that's just fucking great. Next I'll have to swaddle him and change his diapers as he gets used to being dead.

"I'm a vampire," he says. His voice is dry, probably from drinking too much. Not enough liquids. Rookie move. Must have tried to eat the wrong kinds of human food. That's the problem with being dead, your dietary restrictions get a little over the top.

"Yes, you are. Though you're not going to be able to hurt me."

"Why?"

"We're bound by the old law. Laws of the tribe, and all that."

That's a simple way to put it. The old blood, the old world, the old clans, each one an intricate case of warring bloodlines, scrabbling for dominance in that stupidity of the old world. Mostly a combination of a dickmeasuring contest and keeping track of where to find the tastiest humans. Still, the old laws hold sway. The fate of a vampire you've blooded is tied to your own. At least for the first couple of decades.

He shakes his head in dismay, struggling to his feet.

"Look, I'll help you out with everything. Just take my hand."

Frustration and pity. In my opinion, he'd be better off dead. Where did I leave him? Where did I hunt him? When exactly was this?

He looks up with disdain, but eventually takes it, his hand to his head. Throbbing headaches, I assume. Brain adjusting to a lack of oxygen and those lovely growths all over the frontal lobe.

"Everything hurts," he says.

"I know. You get used to it."

Or you don't. You die instead.

With a slight pull, I take him to the living room.

"You're going to have to follow me for a bit, buddy." I try to speak with a comforting tone, but the whole situation just blows. I don't have time to raise a newbie. Maybe I can dump him on someone else. Not that I have a very deep roster, and only a few favors to call in.

I scroll through my contacts, while he eyes me distrustfully. He's awake, true. That's a good sign. Blooding is a complicated thing, and not always successful. Still, you shouldn't take risks. Always drain them to the last drop, or else you'll get a new kid on your hands. Could be ninety years old or five, doesn't matter. They're all children to us.

"Who are you calling?"

"The last one I blooded. She'll be able to help you more than I can."

The phone rings a few times, a combination of disgust and frustration gnawing at my gut.

She picks up. For a brief moment I'm shocked she even answered, though I haven't called for how long? Two years? Five years?

"What the hell do you want?"

Good old Elaine. That's the kind of love and respect you can expect from a bitter ex.

"I have a bit of a problem. A blood problem."

Man, that's the understatement of the year.

"Deal with it yourself."

She hangs up before I can explain, and I sigh, looking down at the weakening man.

Bound by blood.

Bound by fate.

He falls to the ground again, legs shaking and chest convulsing.

Like it or not Elaine, we're all bound here. You'll help me whether you like it or not.

I take him to the bed as the man slips into unconsciousness, spasms and coughs beginning to rack him. Nameless, bloodless, lifeless.

I'll have to get her over here and help me. Looking at him too long brings a sense of nausea, tingles down the spine and numbness in my feet. My own life force, bound to his, may be sucked out to keep him from croaking.

This is the law of the old world, bound by blood and soil. Magic etched in the deep places, forgotten temples and lost cities.

When was the last time I did this? Nineteenth or Eighteenth century? Back when they wore those ridiculous dresses and thought about balancing humors and all that jazz?

Getting a coat from the floor, I make my way to the door. Part of me wonders what his name is. Another part really couldn't be bothered to figure it out.

A ruined apartment, an addition to the bloodline.

What a way to start a morning.
